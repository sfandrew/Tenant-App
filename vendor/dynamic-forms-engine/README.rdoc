= DynamicFormsEngine

#Installation

- In your Gemfile: gem 'dynamic_forms_engine', path: "path/to/gem"
- bundle install
- Install migrations: rake dynamic_forms_engine:install:migrations
- rake db:migrate
- add has_many :dynamic_form_entries, class_name: "DynamicFormsEngine::DynamicFormEntry" to User model
- in config/routes.rb: mount DynamicFormsEngine::Engine => "/dynamic_forms_engine"
- prepend any link paths in application layouts with "main_app.", e.g. "main_app.new_foo_path" instead of "new_foo_path"
- add "bootstrap-datepicker-rails" to your gemfile, '*= require bootstrap-datepicker' to application.css, and '//= require bootstrap-datepicker' to application.js . This is a workaround because rails didn't like it being included in the engine for some reason.

To extend controllers or models, put decorators in i.e. app/decorators/controllers/dynamic_forms_engine/foobars_controller_decorator.rb where it will be included automatically by the engine, e.g.: 
# app/decorators/controllers/dynamic_forms_engine/dynamic_form_types_controller_decorator.rb
DynamicFormsEngine::DynamicFormTypesController.class_eval do
	<add stuff here>
end
